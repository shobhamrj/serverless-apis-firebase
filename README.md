Write some separate nodejs code to call the api 100 times with different random values call the

in each field. Find some package that creates good real looking fake data and

above api with the random data. 3. On write of this document, there should be a trigger that pushes this doc data to

a

bigquery table. 4. Write an firebase function/api to get all the documents of individuals that enjoy cycling

and tennis. Use python for that.
